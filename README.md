## Visualization Plans
**Notes**
County in Crime Index 1 needs to be from 2015 to match Crime Index 2

### Visualization (1)
- Type: Scatter plot
- Interaction: Brushing and Linking
- X axis: Population count
- Y axis: Income number
- Points ploted: County 
- Without the brushing and linking: heat map of Crime Count
- Details on Demand: hover on a point shows the county's name, population and income
- Action: When you brush the County points, it links and changes the other visualizations info 
  
### Visualization (2)
- Type: Map 
- Interaction: Linked with Visualization (1) (Techincally also is like details on demand)
- Action: The county that was brushed in Visualization (1) will be more apparant 
- Detail: On the county in the map, will show the Crime Count, Property Crime Count, Violent Crime Count and Firearm Crime Count.
- Consider: Heat Map to show Crime Count and/or then filter heat map for type of crime counts
- Consider 2: Doing the consideration for heat map, this allows us to hover the number for details on demand
  
### Visualization (3)
- Type: Circle Graph
- Interaction: Linked with Visualization (1)
- Action: The circle is based on the sum of the category (Transportation Types/Employment Types/Ethnicity Types) and the circle breaks down by the category's types.
      - The category that loads is race.
- Consider: Detail on Demand for the calculation of type percentage and population count
- Consider 2: The circle can change size based on the sum of the category
- Consider 3: Detail on Demand for Number of Men and Number of Women
